# GNU/Lag

Welcome to browndawg's highbrown society for programmers and sysadmins.

## Rules

GNU/Lag doesn't have many rules you'd have to explicitly state. Don't be a dick, and you should be fine.

* No CP (we'll report you to every three letter agency in existence).
* **NSFW** content need not be marked. Please mark gore and such as **NSFL**.
* No lurking - you should spend time in channel regularly. In practice, this means that if you're 24/7 logged in, then at least every two weeks, you have to do some non-fake activity. This is to avoid people making local logs without adding anything to the channel. Compare and contrast [m]atrix lurker policy.
* Don't post logs anywhere.
* Don't sneeze whilst getting fingered.

* Definitely not talking about inline skating.

### Can I ask for programming / unix help?

Yes. We're not an official help channel, but regulars will often help you out with technical issues if they have the time (and you're not a dick). If you're going to ask a question, make sure to include what you're doing and what you've tried so far.

### How do I share images / files / text on IRC?

You'll have to host it somewhere, and share a public link.  
We have two services hosted by community members:

* [thecum.zone](https://thecum.zone)
* [p.gnulag.net](https://p.gnulag.net)
* [WaifuPaste](https://waifupaste.moe)

or use public services like:

* [Imgur](https://imgur.com)
* [Teknik](https://teknik.io)
* [TransferSH](https://transfer.sh)
* [Uguu](https://uguu.se)
* [0x0](https://0x0.st)
* [DPaste](https://dpaste.com)

Please note that DCC is disabled on Snoonet.

For code or any arbitrary text really [github gist](https://gist.github.com/) is a good choice.

There are scripts and tools that can automate this for you. Ask on the channel.

Don't be surprised if nobody wants to open a .tar.xz file of yours. [Read more on zip bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb).

## History

### Is this just #linuxmasterrace with porn?

No. Its #lmr with porn, commies and non-whites, ~~minus the [m]atrix lurkers.~~ (PURGED)  
**Not affiliated with the subreddit / channel.**, many regulars show up in both chanels, though. This created border conflicts which later escalated into a full-scale war. #gnulag won the war without losing a single battle.

### How is this related to #redoxmasterrace ?

Designated dumpster reserved for neophiles.

### What is #69

It is a channel funded by our government. It's manufactured opposition, a honeypot for dissidents.
