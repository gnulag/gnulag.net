# GNU/Lag

Welcome to browndawg's lowbrow society for programmers and sysadmins.

## Rules

GNU/Lag doesn't have many rules you'd have to explicitly state. Don't be a dick, and you should be fine.

1. No lurking
  If you're logged in 24/7, then every 12-14 days, you should engage in conversation. This is to avoid people making local logs while not adding anything to the channel. Part of the reason why we purged [m]atrix lurkers.
2. No CP (we'll report you to every three letter agency in existence).
3. **NSFW** content need not be marked. Please mark gore and such as **NSFL**.
4. [PSA](https://gnulag.net/psa.html)
5. Don't post logs anywhere.
6. Don't sneeze whilst getting fingered.

### How do I stay permanently connected to the channel?

Observe our rule #1, aka the "no lurking" rule. If you stay connected and don't chat for 12-14 days, you'll get purged.

* `/mode +j #gnulag`, or google on how to set up `autojoin` in your IRC client.
* If you've been to Snoonet for more than a month, get a [Snoonet BNC](https://snoonet.org/bnc) account (if you don't already have one), 
* set up a [Quassel Core](https://quassel-irc.org/) / [Weechat Relay](https://weechat.org/) / [ZNC server](https://wiki.znc.in/ZNC) somewhere.
* ~~Alternatively, ping **skg** for an account on their server~~. Right now, none of us are running bouncers.


### Can I ask for programming / unix help?

Yes. We're not an official help channel, but regulars will often help you out with technical issues if they have the time (and you're not a dick). If you're going to ask a question, make sure to include what you're doing and what you've tried so far.

### How do I share images / files / text on IRC?

You'll have to host it somewhere, and share a public link. There are scripts and tools that can automate this for you. Ask on the channel.

We have two services hosted by community members:

* [thecum.zone](https://thecum.zone)   - by **Volkor**
* ~~[WaifuPaste](https://waifupaste.moe) - by **skg**~~
* [Pastor](https://c-v.sh)	       - by **audron**
or use public services like:

* [Imgur](https://imgur.com)
* [Teknik](https://teknik.io)
* [TransferSH](https://transfer.sh)
* [Uguu](https://uguu.se)
* [0x0](https://0x0.st)
* [DPaste](https://dpaste.com)

Please note that DCC is disabled on Snoonet.

For code or any arbitrary text really [github gist](https://gist.github.com/) is a good choice.

Note by **belzurix**: [Don't be surprised if nobody wants to open a .tar.xz file of yours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb).

## History

### Is this just #linuxmasterrace with porn?

No. Its #lmr with porn, commies and non-whites, ~~minus the [m]atrix lurkers.~~ (PURGED)
**Not affiliated with the subreddit / channel.**, many regulars show up in both chanels, though. This created border conflicts which later escalated into a full-scale war. #gnulag won the war without losing a single battle.

The #linuxmasterrace also offered shelter to refugees of #gnulag during the tyranny period.

### How is this channel related to the gnulag discord?

The great schism happened during early 2022, but the stormclouds have been congregating since 2021 september. Comrade leader showed animosity towards certain, proven citizens. Then, the CIA left the channel and the goverment collapsed. The comrade leader went full dictator, and when he realized he doesn't want to bother, he set up an interim government to stop the channel's coming breakdown. The interim government could only maintain authority in a small region, people started migrating.

There were three rump states. One of those was the irc channel, one was on telegram, and one is still alive on discord. The telegram quickly collapsed, its downfall coincided with the Russo-Ukrainian war.

After several months, the de facto leaders of the remaining states excommunicated each other, and the period of the Great Petty Schism started.

### How is the channel related to #redoxmasterrace ?

We were temporarely allied with them against the vile necromancers who were trying to make an army from the rotting corpse that #linuxmasterrace is. Update: ultimately, the #lmr reanimation attempt resulted in failure. Most of the lines are fake activity by two people who call each other (and the rest of the people as well) "gey". Pls don't tell them that it's written "ghey".

### What is #69

It was a channel funded by our government. It's manufactured opposition, a honeypot for dissidents. **k33k** was responsible for managing it.

## Bots & Entertainment

Here's [the entire list of gonzobot commands](https://snoonet.org/gonzobot).
